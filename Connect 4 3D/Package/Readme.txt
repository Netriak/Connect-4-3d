- AI difficulty: Influences the complexity of the AI. On the lowest level, it acts pretty much randomly. On the highest level, it is difficult to beat. Note that AI difficulty can be changed midgame.
- Shaders: This option requires a shader model 3 graphics card. It enables better lighting and shadows.
- Skybox: This options also controls the light of the sun. As such, it can have a noticeable performance impact with shaders enabled.
